    "Private lending is when an individual or small company, not a bank, lends money to a real estate investor, usually secured by the property. In Houston, Spring, and the rest of Greater Houston, investors use it to buy and rehab property faster than a bank closing, then pay it off by selling or refinancing.",
    "In Texas the loan is usually documented with a promissory note and a recorded deed of trust. Both sides should use a Texas real estate attorney, because usury, licensing, and homestead rules can apply. This page is education only. It is not an offer to lend, borrow, or invest, and it is not legal or financial advice.",

      question: "What's the difference between private money and hard money?",
      answer:
        "Both are non-bank loans secured by real estate. \"Hard money\" usually means a company that lends to investors as a business, with set rates and points. \"Private money\" often means an individual lender, with terms negotiated deal by deal.",

      question: "Is private lending legal in Texas?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "How do private lenders protect themselves?",
