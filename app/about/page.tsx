                For over 20 years, I&rsquo;ve been deeply immersed in Houston&rsquo;s real estate market. I&rsquo;ve
                helped over 500 families buy their homes, negotiated 50+ investment properties, and educated thousands

              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I&rsquo;m passionate about making real estate education accessible to everyone&mdash;whether
                you&rsquo;re a first-time buyer, investor, or agent looking to scale your business.
